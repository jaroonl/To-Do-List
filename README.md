# To-Do-List

This is a to-do list web app that can help keep track of things you need to do.

At its core, it is able to take in user inputs and save it on a list. You are able to track whether you finished a task and if you want to remove it from your list.
All of your actions will be saved onto the web-browser (even if you refresh). There is also a light mode and dark mode option for whichever the user prefers.

More features are to come but it is complete at its most basic level.
